# Crime-analysis

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing crime data to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations. The goal is to better understand crime distribution across different areas and time periods, identify hotspots, and possibly predict future crime rates using machine learning techniques.

Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Crime Trend Analysis over Time

Geospatial Analysis of Crime Hotspots

Correlation Analysis (e.g., crimes vs socioeconomic factors)

Predictive Modeling (optional, e.g., crime type prediction)

Technologies Used
Python 3.9+

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning (optional)

Folium / Plotly – Geospatial visualization (optional)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab – Development environment

Dataset
Source: [Insert dataset source here, e.g., Kaggle, city open data portal]

Fields include:

Crime Type

Date

Location

Latitude / Longitude

Description

Arrested (Yes/No)
